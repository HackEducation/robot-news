<h3>Teaching Machines and the Automation of Education (of Everyday Life)</h3>
<br />
<p>For a year or so, I've been gathering all the stories I can find about the impending Robot Age. I post these on Saturdays as "The Week in Robots." I've created a subdomain here so that they will all be in one place (although it's going to take me a while to consolidate all my work).</p>

<p>You can find updates to this project <a href="http://robots.hackeducation.com/blog/">here</a>.</p>
