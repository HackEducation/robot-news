<h2>Robots and the Automation of Everyday Life</h2>
<br />

<p>For almost one hundred years, we&#8217;ve told wild stories about robots. The Robot Age has always been almost upon us, at once threatening our lives and our livelihoods and promising a world of machine intelligence and machine labor.</p>

<p>Each week, I update this website with the list of the latest &#8220;robot news.&#8221; These are the stories currently in circulation about the world-to-come and the automation of everyday life.</p>

<p><strong>The Week in Robots</strong>: <a href="http://robots.hackeducation.com/2018/02/03/week-in-robots">3 February 2018</a></p>
