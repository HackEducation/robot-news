<p>Because I&#8217;m shifting into high gear with <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">my book-writing</a>, I won&#8217;t be able to maintain the weekly posts here. &#8220;The Week in Robots&#8221; will resume some time in 2019. I&#8217;m guessing not much will have changed by then &#8211; just a lot more bullshit stories about how they&#8217;re coming for our jobs, our cars, our homes, our children&#8230;</p>
